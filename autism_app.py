    **Classic Autism** (also known as "Autistic Disorder") is the most recognized form of autism and involves a combination of significant language delays, social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviors and interests. 
    Individuals with Classic Autism typically experience severe communication difficulties and struggle to understand social cues. They may exhibit repetitive behaviors, have a strong preference for routines, and show sensitivity to sensory stimuli.
    
    **Key Features:**
    - Severe language delays
    - Limited or absent social engagement
    - Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand-flapping, rocking)
    - Difficulty adapting to changes in routine
    - Sensory sensitivities (e.g., aversion to certain sounds or textures)
    """,
    
    "Asperger's Syndrome": """
    **Asperger's Syndrome** is a higher-functioning form of autism. It is characterized by difficulties in social interactions and nonverbal communication but with no significant delay in language or cognitive development. 
    Individuals with Asperger's often exhibit a deep focus on particular subjects and may excel in specific areas, such as mathematics, science, or art. While they may not have significant language delays, they often struggle with understanding social norms, humor, and body language.

    **Key Features:**
    - Above-average intelligence
    - Social awkwardness or difficulty in forming friendships
    - High focus on specific interests or hobbies
    - Difficulty understanding social cues and nonverbal communication
    """,
    
    "PDD-NOS": """
    **PDD-NOS** (Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified) is a diagnosis for children who have some symptoms of autism but do not fully meet the criteria for any other specific ASD type. 
    It is often used when the child exhibits signs of autism in some areas but not others. Children with PDD-NOS may show developmental delays in areas such as social interaction and communication but may not have the same severity or specificity of symptoms as children with Classic Autism or Asperger's.

    **Key Features:**
    - Partial autism diagnosis, with symptoms not meeting full criteria for other ASD types
    - Variable symptoms: may include communication delays, social difficulties, or repetitive behaviors
    - More flexibility in development than Classic Autism
    """,
    
    "High Functioning Autism": """
    **High Functioning Autism** (HFA) refers to individuals who are on the autism spectrum but possess intellectual abilities within the average or above-average range. 
    HFA individuals may have some social and communication difficulties but are generally capable of living independently and engaging in everyday activities. 
    The term "high functioning" is used to indicate that these individuals may not require as much support as others on the spectrum, though they still struggle with certain social cues and may need support in certain areas like employment or relationships.

    **Key Features:**
    - Intellectual abilities within the average or above-average range
    - Social difficulties, often including trouble with empathy and understanding social norms
    - Can live independently but may need support in certain areas (e.g., employment)
    - May have sensory sensitivities and struggle with certain sensory experiences
